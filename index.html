              <p>Workplace safety is unarguably the most important aspect to any business’s ethos. Because many business operations occur outside of what is considered “normal” working-hours, typically 8 - 5  Monday through Friday, those businesses need a trusted partner that is on-call 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We are that partner! Our typical response time, anywhere in the Metro, to an accident on-the-job or a suspected employee of being under the influence is <span class="bold-text">less than 2-hours!</span></p>
